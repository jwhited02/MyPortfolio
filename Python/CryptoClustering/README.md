# CryptoClustering Project

For this project, I used my knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.


The following Python libraries are required to run this program:

* `pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis.
* `hvplot`: Interactive plotting for dataframes.
* `scikit-learn` (`sklearn`): For machine learning models, clustering, and preprocessing.
  * `KMeans`: Clustering algorithm.
  * `PCA`: Principal Component Analysis for dimensionality reduction.
  * `StandardScaler`: Feature scaling.
  
You can install the necessary packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas hvplot scikit-learn
