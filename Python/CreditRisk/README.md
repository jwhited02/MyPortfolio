# Credit Risk Project

For this project, I was tasked with using various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. To do this, I split the data into training and testing sets, created a logistic regression model with the original data, and wrote a credit risk analysis report. 

### Required Libraries
To run this program, you'll need to have the following Python libraries installed:

* numpy for numerical operations.
* pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
* pathlib for handling file paths.
* scikit-learn for machine learning metrics like confusion_matrix and classification_report.
