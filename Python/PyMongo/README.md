## Instructions

The UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom, and gives them a food hygiene rating. You've been contracted by the editors of a food magazine, Eat Safe, Love, to evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles.

As part of the project, I was asked to update the database with new restaurants, edit some entries, and remove some entries. I was then asked to complete an analysis and answer some questions about the database.

The following Python libraries are required to run this program:
