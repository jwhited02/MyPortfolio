# Alphabet Soup Model Analysis

The nonprofit foundation 'Alphabet Soup' wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. With my knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, I used the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

From 'Alphabet Soup'â€™s business team, I have received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from 'Alphabet Soup' over the years. 

## Results

### Data Preprocessing

#### Target Variable:
- The target variable for this model is `IS_SUCCESSFUL`, which indicates whether or not an applicant successfully used the funds.

#### Feature Variables:
The feature variables used in the model include:
- `APPLICATION_TYPE`
- `AFFILIATION`
- `CLASSIFICATION`
- `USE_CASE`
- `ORGANIZATION`
- `STATUS`
- `INCOME_AMT`
- `SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS`
- `ASK_AMT`

#### Removed Variables:
- The `EIN` and `NAME` columns were removed from the dataset because they are identification numbers that do not contribute to the prediction.

##### Google Colab was used to complete this project, and it is recommended to run this program.
