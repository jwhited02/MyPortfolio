# SQL Project
For this project, I am acting as a HR data analyst for a fictional tech company. My first major task is to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files. I designed the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, imported the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answered questions about the data.
